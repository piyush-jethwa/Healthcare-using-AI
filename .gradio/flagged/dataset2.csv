To address this issue, I recommend washing your hair with a mild shampoo containing zinc pyrithione or ketoconazole, as these ingredients have been shown to reduce flaking and inflammation associated with dandruff. Additionally, using an anti-dandruff shampoo on a regular basis should help control the symptoms.",.gradio\flagged\Patient Audio\ae035a5fdcde944572aa\audio.wav,.gradio\flagged\Doctor Audio\fa96ebcbcafc5b31ee52\final.mp3,2025-04-11 01:26:39.571741

It is often caused by excessive cell shedding, leading to flaking and itching. To treat it, I recommend using an anti-dandruff shampoo containing zinc pyrithione, ketoconazole, or selenium sulfide, and gently massaging it into your scalp before rinsing. Additionally, you can try using an over-the-counter salicylic acid shampoo or medicated conditioner to help reduce flaking and soothe the scalp. If the condition persists, it may be a sign of seborrheic dermatitis, a condition that also causes redness and irritation. In that case, I would suggest consulting a healthcare professional for prescription-strength treatment.",.gradio\flagged\Patient Audio\8cecb6cea32fcd9a87c8\audio.wav,.gradio\flagged\Doctor Audio\a3711f4d20ef8af1ddb7\final.mp3,2025-04-11 01:30:21.138722
