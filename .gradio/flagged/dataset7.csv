To address this, consider using an over-the-counter anti-dandruff shampoo containing zinc pyrithione or ketoconazole for at least a month. Additionally, regular scalp massages with oils like coconut or olive oil can help reduce flaking and soothe your scalp. If symptoms persist, consult a dermatologist for further guidance.",.gradio\flagged\Doctor Audio\81219709ee7f90fa84bd\final.wav,2025-04-11 02:31:00.745046

Based on your symptoms and condition, I suspect you may be suffering from seborrheic dermatitis or a fungal infection.

* I recommend using an antifungal shampoo or a medicated dandruff shampoo to treat the condition.
* In addition to using a medicated shampoo, I suggest that you should also:
  * Use a coal-based powder or a dandruff treatment available in the market
  * Keep your head a bit dry.",.gradio\flagged\Doctor Audio\58d26852a3d6844cc41f\final.wav,2025-04-11 14:08:36.505952
