## üîç Problem Statement

Many individuals in semi-urban and rural areas face barriers in accessing timely medical consultations due to limited infrastructure, lack of healthcare professionals, and language challenges. There is a need for a virtual system that can understand patients' input through various mediums and provide basic diagnostics and support in multiple languages.

## üí° Approach & Solution

**Advance HealthCare** is a virtual health assistant that utilizes AI/ML to offer preliminary diagnosis through natural input methods: **voice**, **text**, and **image**. It consists of four modular phases including diagnosis logic, speech recognition and synthesis, and a web UI interface using **Gradio**.

The system allows users to interact in their preferred language (Hindi, English, Marathi), making it highly accessible and user-friendly.

## ‚ú® Features

- üéô Voice input for patient symptoms
- üìÑ Text input for faster interaction
- üñº Image input (for basic visual symptom detection)
- üß† AI-powered diagnosis engine
- üó£ Multilingual output via Text-to-Speech (gTTS)
- üí¨ Gradio UI for web-based interaction
- üßæ Modular architecture (4 distinct components)

## üõ† Tech Stack

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries/Frameworks:** Gradio, gTTS, SpeechRecognition, OpenCV, PIL
- **Tools:** FFmpeg, PortAudio
- **OS Compatibility:** Windows, macOS, Linux
- **Python Version:** 3.11+

## Setting Up a Python Virtual Environment

### Using Pipenv
1. **Install Pipenv (if not already installed):**  
```
pip install pipenv
```

2. **Install Dependencies with Pipenv:** 

```
pipenv install
```

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment:** 

```
pipenv shell
```

---

### Using `pip` and `venv`
#### Create a Virtual Environment:
```
python -m venv venv
```

#### Activate the Virtual Environment:
**macOS/Linux:**
```
source venv/bin/activate
```

**Windows:**
```
venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### Install Dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### Using Conda
#### Create a Conda Environment:
```
